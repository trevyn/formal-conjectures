Are there infinitely many $n$ such that $n-k^2$ is prime for all $k$ with $(n,k)=1$ and $k^2 < n$?

In [Va99] it is asked whether $968$ is the largest integer with this property, but this is an
error, since for example $968-9=7\cdot 137$.

The list of $n$ satisfying the given property is [A214583] in the OEIS. The largest known such $n$
is $1722$.
