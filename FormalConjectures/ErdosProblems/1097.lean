Given a finite set of integers `A` (modelled as a `Finset ℤ`), the set
`CommonDifferencesThreeTermAP A` consists of all integers `d` such that there
is a non-trivial three-term arithmetic progression `a, b, c ∈ A` with
`b - a = d` and `c - b = d`.

def CommonDifferencesThreeTermAP (A : Finset ℤ) : Set ℤ :=
  {d : ℤ | d ≠ 0 ∧ ∃ a ∈ A, ∃ b ∈ A, ∃ c ∈ A, b - a = d ∧ c - b = d}

/--
The main conjecture: for any finite set of integers $A$ with $|A| = n$, the number of distinct
common differences in three-term arithmetic progressions is $O(n^{3/2})$.

theorem erdos_1097 : answer(sorry) ↔ ∃ C > (0 : ℝ), ∀ (A : Finset ℤ),
    (CommonDifferencesThreeTermAP A).ncard ≤ C * (A.card : ℝ) ^ (3 / 2 : ℝ) := by
  sorry

/--
A weaker bound has been proven: there are always at most $n^2$ such values of $d$.

    ∀ A, (CommonDifferencesThreeTermAP A).ncard ≤ A.card ^ 2 := by
  sorry

/--
A trivial lower bound: for sufficiently large `n` there exist sets $A$ with $|A| = n$ that contain at least $\Omega(n)$
distinct common differences of three-term arithmetic progressions.
